    <p>Finance Tracker was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate financial experts and technology enthusiasts.

We started with a small team, fueled by the belief that everyone deserves the power to control their financial destiny. Over the years, Finance Tracker has grown from a humble beginning into a robust and trusted platform. We continually evolve, integrating advanced features and user-centric designs, always staying true to our core mission of empowering millions to achieve financial stability and growth.</p>
